# DataScienceAppsForBeginnersUsingShinyR
Open the .r files and lauch the shiny app in Rstudio (ctrl+shift+enter) or (cmd+shift+enter) 

1. Linear Regression dataset: The dataset "cost_revenue_dirty.csv" originally belongs to https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/budgets. But I've taken this dataset from a course I learned linear regression on python from. Here's the link to that udemy course "https://www.udemy.com/course/python-data-science-machine-learning-bootcamp/".
I would like to state it again that I don't own this dataset and I've mentioned the links of where I found it. I'm not affiliated to the udemy course (mentioned above) in any way. I'm only giving credit where it's due.

2. Gradient descent algorithm: I was following the above mentioned course on UDEMY, then it hit me that I could create a gradient descent app on R shiny based on the logic, the instructor taught. That's my inspiration for this gradient descent shiny app. Again, the code is my own, but I learned the logic from the above mentioned udemy course.
