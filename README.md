# DataScienceAppsForBeginnersUsingShinyR
The goal of this series is to teach beginners "how to program".
It doesn't matter what language you learn as your first. Even I find myself switching between python and R many times in a single working day.
In my opinion, the best way to learn is to first, set aside your thirst of getting everything perfectly right, and follow a project. Try to figure out, why the instructor did what he did while "using a function" or writing a block of code.
