# DataScienceAppsForBeginnersUsingShinyR

This is an interactive visualization app on R Shiny.
Linear Regression model is used between productionBudget and worldwideGross.

Launch the app in Rstudio (ctrl+shift+enter) or (cmd+shift+enter) and select the area on the plot to get more details.

The dataset "cost_revenue_dirty.csv" originally belongs to https://www.the-numbers.com/movie/budgets. But I've taken this dataset from a course I learned linear regression on python from. Here's the link to that udemy course "https://www.udemy.com/course/python-data-science-machine-learning-bootcamp/".

I would like to state it again that I don't own this dataset and I've mentioned the links of where I found it. 
I'm not affiliated to the udemy course (mentioned above) in any way. I'm only giving credit where it's due.
